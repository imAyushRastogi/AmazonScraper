# Amazon Best Seller Books in Personal Transformation Web Scraping Project
============================================================

## Introduction
This project is a web scraping script that extracts the top 50 best seller books in the Personal Transformation category from Amazon. The script uses Python, BeautifulSoup, and Requests to scrape the data and stores it in a CSV and JSON file.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* `requests` library
* `beautifulsoup4` library
* `pandas` library
* `json` library

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script using `scrape.py`.
3. The script will scrape the data and store it in `books.csv` and `books.json` files.

## Output
The script will generate two files:

* `books.csv`: a CSV file containing the scraped data with columns for Best Seller ranking, Title, and Author.
* `books.json`: a JSON file containing the scraped data in a JSON format.

## Note
* This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial purposes.
* Amazon's terms of service prohibit scraping, so use this script at your own risk.
* The script may break if Amazon changes its website structure or HTML.
